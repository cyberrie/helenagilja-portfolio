## Overview

This challenge was completed to consolidate this week's learnings (flexbox, CSS grid, media queries, and CSS variables) and create my portfolio page to showcase my skills and talents to potential employers.

I will build on this as I progress through my bootcamp course.

## The Challenge

I was given some critical requirements neccessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## My Process

I have started working on my portfolio page last week, so slightly ahead of the schedule.

I have used pen and paper to sketch my initial layout. After this week, I have learned

For my main layout, I have decided to use Flexbox and Grid nested within portfolio section of my page. I now understand this can be built using grid layout fully, howvever as I am almost done will leave it.
